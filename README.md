# Software Foundations

## Volume 1

- Logical Foundations is the entry-point to the series. It covers functional programming, basic concepts of logic, computer-assisted theorem proving, and Coq. ([link](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/lf-current/toc.html))

## Volume 2

- Programming Language Foundations surveys the theory of programming languages, including operational semantics, Hoare logic, and static type systems. ([link](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/plf-current/toc.html))

## Volume 3

- Verified Functional Algorithms shows how a variety of fundamental data structures can be specified and mechanically verified.

## Volume 4

- QuickChick: Property-Based Testing in Coq introduces tools for combining randomized property-based testing with formal specification and proof in the Coq ecosystem.

## Volume 5

- Verifiable C is an extended hands-on tutorial on specifying and verifying real-world C programs using the Princeton Verified Software Toolchain.


## Volume 6

- Separation Logic Foundations is an in-depth introduction to separation logic—a practical approach to modular verification of imperative programs—and how to build program verification tools on top of it.
